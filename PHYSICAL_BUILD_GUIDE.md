# Physical Build Guide

A step-by-step guide to recreating your digital string art in physical form.

## Materials Needed

### Frame
- **Square wooden board**: 50cm x 50cm to 100cm x 100cm
- **Thickness**: At least 2cm for stability
- **Material**: Plywood, MDF, or solid wood
- **Finish**: Paint or stain (optional)

### Pegs
- **Type**: Small nails, finishing nails, or brass pins
- **Quantity**: Match your digital design (e.g., 200 for 50 pegs/side)
- **Length**: 2-3cm
- **Color**: Match or contrast with thread

### Thread
- **Type**: Cotton, polyester, or nylon thread
- **Color**: Black is traditional, but any color works
- **Thickness**: #10 crochet thread or similar
- **Length**: 1-2 kilometers (for 2500-4000 iterations)

### Tools
- Hammer
- Ruler or measuring tape
- Pencil
- Printed peg connection instructions
- Optional: Drill with small bit for pilot holes
- Optional: Spray paint or wood stain for finish

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Frame

1. **Cut your board** to desired square size
2. **Sand** all edges and surfaces smooth
3. **Apply finish** if desired (paint/stain) and let dry completely
4. **Mark the center** of each edge

### 2. Mark Peg Positions

**For 50 pegs per side (200 total):**

1. Calculate spacing: `side_length / pegs_per_side`
   - Example: 80cm / 50 = 1.6cm spacing

2. **Top edge** (left to right):
   - Start at left corner
   - Mark every 1.6cm along the edge
   - 50 marks total

3. **Right edge** (top to bottom):
   - Continue from last top mark
   - Mark every 1.6cm down the right side
   - 50 more marks

4. **Bottom edge** (right to left):
   - Continue from last right mark
   - Mark every 1.6cm across bottom
   - 50 more marks

5. **Left edge** (bottom to top):
   - Continue from last bottom mark
   - Mark every 1.6cm up the left side
   - 50 more marks (200 total)

**Important**: Number each position clearly (0-199 for 200 pegs)

### 3. Install Pegs

1. **Optional**: Drill small pilot holes at each mark
   - Prevents wood splitting
   - Makes hammering easier

2. **Hammer nails**:
   - Drive each nail to same depth (~1cm protruding)
   - Keep nails perpendicular to board
   - Double-check numbering as you go

3. **Test**:
   - Ensure all nails are secure
   - Check that none wobble
   - Verify all are same height

### 4. String the Art

**Setup**:
1. Tie thread to starting peg (from your exported instructions)
2. Leave ~10cm tail for securing later
3. Keep thread spool/ball nearby

**Process**:
1. Follow exported instructions exactly:
   ```
   1. Peg 0 → 2. Peg 45 → 3. Peg 123 → 4. Peg 67...
   ```

2. **Wrap technique**:
   - Pull thread from current peg to next peg
   - Make one wrap around target peg
   - Pull moderately tight (not too tight!)
   - Continue to next peg

3. **Maintain tension**:
   - Keep consistent tightness throughout
   - Don't pull so tight that pegs bend
   - Thread should be taut but not strained

4. **Take breaks**:
   - For 2500 iterations, expect 2-4 hours
   - Mark your position if you need to stop
   - Don't rush - consistency matters

5. **Final peg**:
   - Make extra wraps around final peg
   - Tie off securely
   - Trim excess thread
   - Add dot of glue for security (optional)

### 5. Finishing Touches

1. **Secure starting tail**: Tie off and trim
2. **Check coverage**: Look for any loose threads
3. **Frame it** (optional): Add glass cover to protect
4. **Mount**: Add hanging hardware to back

## Tips for Success

### Before Starting
- ✓ Test a small section first (50 iterations)
- ✓ Have good lighting
- ✓ Organize your workspace
- ✓ Print instructions clearly
- ✓ Consider a helper to check off steps

### During Construction
- ✓ Work methodically, don't skip pegs
- ✓ Keep the instruction sheet marked
- ✓ Take photo breaks to track progress
- ✓ If you make a mistake, unwind to fix it
- ✓ Maintain consistent thread tension

### Common Mistakes
- ✗ Pegs at uneven heights → Uneven appearance
- ✗ Inconsistent spacing → Distorted image
- ✗ Wrong thread tension → Sagging or pulling
- ✗ Losing place in instructions → Wrong pattern
- ✗ Rushing → Poor quality

## Time Estimates

| Iterations | Stringing Time | Total Project Time |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1000      | 1-2 hours      | 3-4 hours         |
| 2500      | 2-4 hours      | 5-7 hours         |
| 4000      | 4-6 hours      | 8-12 hours        |

*Total time includes frame prep and peg installation*

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Thread keeps breaking
- **Solution**: Use stronger thread or reduce tension

**Problem**: Image not recognizable
- **Solution**: Check peg numbering, ensure following instructions exactly

**Problem**: Thread slipping off pegs
- **Solution**: Pegs may be too smooth - roughen slightly with sandpaper

**Problem**: Board warping
- **Solution**: Use thicker board or add support frame on back

**Problem**: Lost place in instructions
- **Solution**: Check photo of current state, count recent connections

## Material Costs (Estimate)

- Frame materials: $10-30
- Pegs/nails (200): $5-15
- Thread (2km): $10-20
- Tools (if needed): $20-50
- **Total**: $45-115 (excluding tools)

## Display Options

1. **Wall Mount**: Simple and classic
2. **Frame with Glass**: Protects from dust
3. **Backlit**: LED strip behind for dramatic effect
4. **Rotating Mount**: View from both sides
5. **Gallery Wire**: Professional hanging

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Color Designs
- Use separate thread colors
- Follow color-specific instruction sets
- Layer colors in order

### Double-Sided
- Use transparent or semi-transparent board
- String visible from both sides
- Place near window for light effect

### Large Scale
- Scale up to 150cm or larger
- Use thicker thread
- Increase peg count proportionally

## Documentation

**Recommended Photos**:
1. Empty frame with marked pegs
2. Progress at 25%, 50%, 75%
3. Completed piece from front
4. Close-up details
5. Side view showing thread depth

## Sharing Your Work

Consider sharing:
- Time-lapse video of creation
- Before/after comparison
- Digital vs. physical side-by-side
- Close-up detail shots
- Lessons learned

## Safety Notes

- ⚠ Wear safety glasses when hammering
- ⚠ Watch for splinters when handling wood
- ⚠ Keep sharp tools away from children
- ⚠ Work in well-ventilated area if using finishes
- ⚠ Take breaks to avoid repetitive strain

## Maintenance

- Dust gently with soft brush
- Avoid direct sunlight (fading)
- Keep away from moisture
- Check tension annually
- Repair loose pegs promptly
